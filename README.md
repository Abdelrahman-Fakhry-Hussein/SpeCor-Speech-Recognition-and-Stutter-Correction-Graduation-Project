# SpeCor: Specialized Correction for Enhanced ASR

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology has significantly advanced, yet it struggles with accurately transcribing speech from individuals with disorders like stuttering and lisping. SpeCor addresses these limitations by incorporating specialized correction mechanisms for these disorders, enhancing ASR accuracy and communication accessibility.

## Key Features

- **Minimalist Preprocessing**: Focuses on robust training with noise and data augmentation to simulate real-world conditions.
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to capture essential sound characteristics (i.e., phonemes).
- **Advanced Modeling**: Leverages the Whisper model along with the advanced GPT-2 tokenizer to process diverse speech patterns.
- **Impressive Results**: Evaluations using LibriSpeech and LibriStutter datasets show significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) for speech with impediments, reducing WER from 95.5% to 16%.
- **Efficient Architecture**: SpeCorâ€™s architecture, featuring convolutional layers and transformer blocks, ensures stable and efficient training.

## Benefits

This innovation not only enhances the user experience for individuals with speech impediments but also paves the way for further advancements in assistive technologies. By addressing the unique challenges of speech disorders, SpeCor fosters a more inclusive digital future where everyone can communicate effortlessly using voice-based technologies.
